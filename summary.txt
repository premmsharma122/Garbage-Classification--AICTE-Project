GARBAGE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM - CODE SUMMARY
============================================

OVERVIEW:
This project implements a deep learning-based garbage classification system using TensorFlow/Keras with EfficientNetV2B2 as the base model. The system can classify different types of waste materials to help with recycling and waste management.

HOW THE CODE WORKS:
==================

1. ENVIRONMENT SETUP & IMPORTS:
   - Installs required packages: seaborn, tensorflow, gradio
   - Imports essential libraries: numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, sklearn, gradio
   - Sets up all necessary modules for deep learning, data visualization, and web interface

2. DATASET CONFIGURATION:
   - Defines flexible dataset path with multiple alternatives for different environments
   - Sets image size to 124x124 pixels for model input
   - Configures batch size (32) and random seed (42) for reproducible results
   - Automatically searches for dataset in common locations

3. DATA LOADING & PREPROCESSING:
   - Loads training dataset (80% of data) using tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory
   - Loads validation dataset (20% of data) with same configuration
   - Splits validation set into validation and test sets (50-50 split)
   - Applies caching and prefetching for optimal performance
   - Extracts class names from the dataset

4. DATA EXPLORATION & VISUALIZATION:
   - Displays sample images from each class in a 4x3 grid
   - Calculates class distribution percentages for train/validation/test sets
   - Creates bar plots showing class distribution across all datasets
   - Helps identify class imbalance issues

5. CLASS IMBALANCE HANDLING:
   - Computes class weights using sklearn's compute_class_weight
   - Balances the dataset by giving higher weights to underrepresented classes
   - Creates a dictionary mapping class indices to their respective weights

6. DATA AUGMENTATION:
   - Implements data augmentation pipeline using Sequential model
   - Applies random horizontal flip, rotation (10%), zoom (10%), and contrast (10%)
   - Helps improve model generalization and reduces overfitting

7. MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
   - Uses EfficientNetV2B2 as base model (pre-trained on ImageNet)
   - Freezes first 100 layers to retain pre-trained features
   - Adds custom classification head:
     * Input layer (124x124x3)
     * Data augmentation layer
     * EfficientNetV2B2 base model
     * Global Average Pooling
     * Dropout (30% rate)
     * Dense output layer with softmax activation

8. MODEL COMPILATION:
   - Uses Adam optimizer with learning rate 1e-4
   - Sparse categorical crossentropy loss for multi-class classification
   - Tracks accuracy as the primary metric

9. TRAINING CALLBACKS:
   - Early stopping: stops training if validation loss doesn't improve for 3 epochs
   - Learning rate reduction: reduces LR by factor 0.2 if val_loss plateaus
   - Restores best weights after early stopping

10. MODEL TRAINING:
    - Trains for 10 epochs with class weights to handle imbalance
    - Uses validation data for monitoring performance
    - Plots training/validation accuracy and loss curves
    - Visualizes learning progress over epochs

11. MODEL EVALUATION:
    - Evaluates model on test dataset
    - Generates confusion matrix and classification report
    - Calculates precision, recall, and F1-score for each class
    - Visualizes confusion matrix as heatmap

12. PREDICTION VISUALIZATION:
    - Shows sample predictions on test images
    - Displays true vs predicted labels with confidence scores
    - Helps assess model performance visually

13. MODEL SAVING:
    - Saves trained model in Keras format (.keras file)
    - Preserves model architecture, weights, and training configuration
    - Enables easy loading for future inference

14. WEB INTERFACE DEPLOYMENT:
    - Creates Gradio interface for easy model deployment
    - Implements classify_image function that:
      * Resizes input image to 124x124
      * Applies EfficientNet preprocessing
      * Makes prediction using trained model
      * Returns formatted result with confidence score
    - Launches web interface accessible via browser
